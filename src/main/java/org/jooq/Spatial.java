/**
 * A wrapper type for spatial data obtained from the database.
 * <p>
 * The wrapper represents spatial {@link #data()} in serialised string form
 * either as a well known text (WKT) or well known binary in hex format (WKB),
 * depending on your dialect's default behaviour. A
 * <code>CAST(NULL AS â€¦)</code> value is represented by a
 * <code>null</code> reference of type {@link Spatial}, not as
 * <code>data() == null</code>. This is consistent with jOOQ's general way of
 * returning <code>NULL</code> from {@link Result} and {@link Record} methods.
 * <p>
 * This data type is supported only by the commercial editions of jOOQ.
